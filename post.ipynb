    "Every year around this time I get frustrated with the weather because I'm ready for pants, boots, and hot beverages, but summer always seems to hold on for a bit too long (this week, during the autumnal equinox, it reached >90º F). Each year this gets me thinking: Am I being impatient? Am I misremembering the past? Or have the last few years really been excessively warm in the early fall? Am I already perceiving climate change / global warming? This year, motivated by the [Climate Strike](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/nyregion/climate-strike-nyc.html), I decided to do more than bemoan the lingering summer, so I signed up for a developer account with [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev) and started downloading historical weather data.
